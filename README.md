# Malware Classification with Machine Learning
### By: Austin Hale

This notebook uses a dataset of information from Kaggle which can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sankethiyer/malware-classification-clustering

The goal of the project is to train a model to successfully classify between benign activity and malware from the given data using 4 different machine learning algorithms:
* Unsupervised (Clustering)
    - K-Means
    - Agglomerative Clustering
* Supervised (Classification)
    - KNN
    - Random Forest
